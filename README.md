# Playblix
New Game Platform better then roblox!

#1 Why Better?

1. Cross-platform Windows,Linux,MacOS,Phones
2. More responsibility from the administration to the players, etc.
3. Shorter ban periods for accounts in Roblox: 6 months, permanent ban, in Playblix: 1 month, 1 year, no permanent bans. Only long bans. But we only ban pedophiles and hackers who harm players forever!

#2 Where it is inferior to roblox 
1. The platform is so new that its physical server consists of a Lenovo laptop.
2. Small Budget.
3. Number of employees, damn, there are none, only 1 and that's the creator.
4. Quality and Features.

#3 What was it written on?

1. C++,JavaScript,Lua Lua-- I'm not stealing the idea from Roblox because Lua is also in Garry's Mod.
2. VsCode.
